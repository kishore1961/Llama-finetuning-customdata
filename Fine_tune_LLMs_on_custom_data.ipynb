            "Answer: MEMA played a crucial role in coordinating the response to the 2023 wildfires. MEMA is responsible for coordinating emergency response and management for the County of Maui. In the case of the 2023 wildfires, MEMA worked with other emergency response agencies, such as the Maui Fire Department, the Maui Police Department, and the Hawaii National Guard, to manage the response and evacuation efforts.
